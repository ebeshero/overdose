## Terms and Concepts

- **Spatial Presence (aka. Immersion)** is when users are cognitively/emotionally engulfed in media that can be perceived as "real". Essentially, the player forms a mental model of the imaginary world that they are participating in, and subliminaly applies the notion that it could take place in our physical reality. Typically this can be induced by having "multiple channels of sensory information, completness of sensory information, cognitively demanding environments, and a strong narrative, plot, or story" (Madigan 10). The following are the conceptualized steps that induces spatial presence. Note that the steps are directly taken from Madigan's article.
    1. Players form a representation in their minds of the space or world with which the game is presenting them.
    2. Players being to favor the media-based space (I.e., the game world) as their point of reference for where they "are" ("primary ego reference frame")

- **Suspension of Disbelief** are instances in story telling and or media where individuals will wilfully ignore details that do not make sense, and accept the rules that are established in the imaginary world.
- **Agency** is defined as the feeling individuals inhabit when having authority over their intentions, actions, and outcomes. If a player interacts with the world around them but has unseen or little effect, there is no agency. If the player interacts with the world, but an unintended outcome occurs, there is no agency. If the player interacts with the world with the desired outcome, agency is present.
- **Transformation** can be organized into three subtypes.
    - *Transformation as masquerade* is defined as the experience allowing the "players to transform themselves into others for the duration of the experience".
    - *Transformation as variety* means that a game offers a wide variety of experiences, allowing players to explore each variation and "gain an understanding of the theme."
    - *Personal transformation* is defined as the journey the player experiences that causes personal transformation.

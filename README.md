# Overdose

## Summary

Welcome to the *Overdose* repo for its related prototypes &amp; assets. *Overdose* is intended to be a game that 
depicts the consequences of drug use and addiction, while balancing arcade features and style.

*Overdose's* mechanics will consist of drug abuse, psychological decline, social stigma, and criminal acts; 
all 
of which, especially together, can be considered tasteless or controversial.  The intention is not to make drugs or 
unlawful behavior look appealing or "silly". *Overdose* is meant to artistically express the parts of society 
where these cycles of addictions are present. It will portray issues like police brutality, 
homelessness, and societal apathy/group think; on top of demonstrating the real-world effects of certain drugs.

Despite the game's dark themes, *Overdose* aims to be first and foremost, **fun**. The 
player will not pick up on anything if they are not immersed in the world. The easiest, most entertaining way to 
immerse 
the player is through **fun**. So, its gameplay will attempt to be a reflection of the fast-paced, unpredictable 
nature of electronic music 
and rave culture. The player will constantly be on the move trying to get their next fix, while perpetually falling 
into a chaotic environment, or psychotic madness.
